# Problem 1: Bank Account

In the first problem, you are given an existing implementation of a simple BankAccount.

## Subtask 1
The implementation is not very good and has some bugs and typos, so you are being asked to find and correct all the anomalies you can find in the code. 

Please try to create a single commit for this change before moving on to the next subtask.

## Subtask 2
There is a request to enrich the transaction history functionality. 

After the change, the history must include all transactions in the account, included failed transactions. 

The log should also include the transaction status out of (“COMPLETED”, “REJECTED”, “INVALID”) and the date when the transaction was attempted.
