# Technical challenges

## General

In your assignment today, you have two mandatory exercises. An additional optional exercise is provided.

**Tackle the mandatory tasks first**. Once you are satisfied with your solution, you may continue to the optional exercise. Completing the optional exercise will provide you additional points.

**In this segment of the interview process, you are kindly requested not to use internet resources or AI agents to help you complete your task.**

You have **1.5 hours** to complete the test.

The code must be functional at the end of the exercise!

You are expected to prove that your code works. For the sake of simplicity, just validate it by executing the function with different inputs (unit testing not required).

The second problem requires you to write Java code. For the other problems, you can choose your programming language out of Java/Kotlin, Python or TypeScript.

Your code will be evaluated for correctness, clarity, conciseness, efficiency and edge cases. Try to make the code as easier to read and understand as you can.

You get bonus points if you document your thought process, rationals and alternative implementations as a general comment at the start of your code for each problem. Also, you can use comments in the code explaining any non trivial decision.

Given the nature of the exercise, questions and clarifications are not allowed once the test has started. If you have doubts, take assumptions and document them.


**Good luck!**

# Setup

At the end of the exercise, you will be requested to push your code to a repository in GitHub.

Clone the following repository (assumes you have an ssh key registered in GitHub for your computer):

```
git clone git@github.com:<your-user-name>/12022025-kamatech-day.git

git checkout -b <your-name>
```

Inside the _12022025-kamatech-day_ repository, you will find the problem statements and the files you will use during the test where relevant.

There is a directory for each of the problems. Make sure to put the files in the right directory!

You can work with git as you are used to (e.g. a commit per problem). If you are not very experienced with git, once you are done with your tests just do this:

```
git add .

git commit -m “Full set of answers“

git push origin main
```

Do use your IDE to push your changes if you are more comfortable that way.
